# StudentHive

StudentHive is a project that utilizes React for the frontend, and MongoDB, Fastify, and Node.js for the backend. This guide covers the steps required for deploying the application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest stable version)
- MongoDB (installed and running)
- Fastify (configured within your Node.js project)
- Git (for version control and code deployment)

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React-based frontend code.
- `backend/`: Contains the Fastify/Node.js-based backend code.
- `database/`: Contains the MongoDB-related files or scripts.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine or deployment server.

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd StudentHive
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

In the `backend/` directory, create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables for your application. This might include MongoDB connection details, authentication keys, or other sensitive information.

```bash
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend and backend directories and install the required dependencies.

- For the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

- For the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 4. Build the Frontend

To build the React frontend, run the following command from the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a production-ready build in the `frontend/build/` folder.

### 5. Deploy the Backend

Start the Fastify/Node.js backend from the `backend/` directory:

```bash
node app.js
```

Verify that the server is running correctly by accessing `http://localhost:3000` or whichever port you specified.

### 6. Deploy the Frontend

Serve the built React frontend from a static file server. You can use Fastify, Express, or other static file servers. An example for Fastify is:

```bash
const path = require('path');
fastify.register(require('@fastify/static'), {
  root: path.join(__dirname, '../frontend/build'),
  prefix: '/public/',
});
```

### 7. Access the Application

With both frontend and backend running, open a web browser and go to your server's URL to interact with StudentHive.

### 8. Deployment to a Platform (Optional)

For deployment to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure, consult their documentation on Node.js and React app deployment. Be sure to set up necessary configurations, environment variables, and scaling considerations.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
- Double-check environment variables for accuracy.
- Verify that both frontend and backend dependencies are installed.
- Check server logs for errors.
